# ⚡ **StringCompare**: Efficient String Comparison Functions

**StringCompare** is a Python package for efficient string similarity computation and approximate string matching. It is inspired by the excellent [*comparator*](https://github.com/ngmarchant/comparator) and [*stringdist*](https://github.com/markvanderloo/stringdist) R packages, and from the equally excellent [*py_stringmatching*](https://github.com/anhaidgroup/py_stringmatching), [*jellyfish*](https://github.com/jamesturk/jellyfish), and [*textdistance*](https://github.com/life4/textdistance) Python packages.

The key feature of **StringCompare** is a focus on speed, extensibility and maintainability through its [*pybind11* ](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11) C++ implementation. **StringCompare** is faster than other Python libraries (see benchmark below) and much more memory efficient when dealing with long strings.

The [complete API documentation](https://olivierbinette.github.io/StringCompare/source/stringcompare.html) is available on the project website [olivierbinette.github.io/StringCompare](https://olivierbinette.github.io/StringCompare).

## Installation

Install the latest version from github using the following commands:

```bash
    pip install setuptools wheel pybind11
    git clone https://github.com/OlivierBinette/StringCompare.git
    pip install -e ./StringCompare
```

## Project Roadmap

**StringCompare** currently implements [edit distances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edit_distance) and similarity functions, such as the Levenshtein, Damerau-Levenshtein, Jaro, and Jaro-Winkler distances. This is *stage 1* of the following development roadmap: 

| Stage  | Goals | Status|
| :-------------: | ------------- | :-------------: |
| 1  | pybind11 framework and edit-based distances (Levenshtein, Damerau-Levenshtein, Jaro, and Jaro-Winkler) | ✔️ |
| 2  | Token-based and hybrid distances (tf-idf similarity, LSH, Monge-Elkan, ...)  | ... |
| 3  | Vocabulary optimizations and metric trees | ...  |
| 4  | Embeddings and string distance learning | ...  |



## Examples

Comparison algorithms are instanciated as `Comparator` object, which provides the `compare()` method (equivalent to `__call__()`) for string comparison.


```python
from stringcompare import Levenshtein, Jaro, JaroWinkler, DamerauLevenshtein, LCSDistance

lev = Levenshtein(normalize=True, similarity=False)

lev("Olivier", "Oliver") # same as lev.compare("Olivier", "Oliver")
```




    0.14285714285714285



Comparator objects also provide the `elementwise()` function for elementwise comparison between lists


```python
lev.elementwise(["Olivier", "Olivier"], ["Oliver", "Olivia"])
```




    array([0.14285714, 0.26666667])



and the `pairwise()` function for pairwise comparisons.


```python
lev.pairwise(["Olivier", "Oliver"], ["Olivier", "Olivia"])
```




    array([[0.        , 0.26666667],
           [0.14285714, 0.28571429]])



## Benchmark

Comparison of the Damerau-Levenshtein implementation speed for different Python packages, when comparing the strings "Olivier Binette" and "Oilvier Benet":


```python
from timeit import timeit
from tabulate import tabulate

# Comparison functions
from stringcompare import DamerauLevenshtein
cmp = DamerauLevenshtein()
from jellyfish import damerau_levenshtein_distance
from textdistance import damerau_levenshtein

functions = {
    "StringCompare": cmp.compare,
    "jellyfish": damerau_levenshtein_distance,
    "textdistance": damerau_levenshtein,
}

table = [
    [name, timeit(lambda: fun("Olivier Binette", "Oilvier Benet"), number=1000000) * 1000]
    for name, fun in functions.items()
]
print(tabulate(table, headers=["Package", "avg runtime (ns)"]))
```

    Package          avg runtime (ns)
    -------------  ------------------
    StringCompare             733.214
    jellyfish                1009.11
    textdistance             4065.03


### Performance notes

The use of pybind11 comes with a small performance overhead. We could be faster if we directly interfaced with CPython.

However, the use of pybind11 allows the library to be easily extensible and maintainable. The C++ implementation has little to worry about Python, excepted for the use of a pybind11 numpy wrapper in some places. Pybind11 takes care of the details of exposing the C++ API to Python.

## Known Bugs

*pybind11* has compatibility issues with gcc 11 (e.g. on Ubuntu 21.10). If running Linux and `gcc --version` is 11, then use the following commands to configure your environment before (re)installing:
```bash
        sudo apt install g++-9 gcc-9
        export CC=gcc-9 CXX=g++-9
```
Then reinstall using:
```bash
        make clean
        pip install --force-reinstall -e StringCompare/
```
If this is unsuccessful, you might want to use **StringCompare** within a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container. I recommend using the python:3.7.9 base image. For example, after installing docker, you can launch an interactive bash session and install **StringCompare** as follows:
```bash
        sudo docker run -it python:3.7.9 bash
        git clone https://github.com/OlivierBinette/StringCompare.git
        pip install setuptools pybind11
        pip install -e ./StringCompare
        python
        >>> import stringcompare
```
